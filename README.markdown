A Ruby server for amalgamating World of Warcraft guild achievement feeds.

It's _incredibly_ early - don't expect to see anything in the source other than a couple of models. But the intent is to replace [GuildAchievements](http://jerakeen.org/code/guildachievements) with something that I can run for other people and will thereofre be useful.

For what it's worth, there's a live version of this codebase running at <http://achievements.heroku.com>.
